## Bitwise operations
- 29 Divide Two Integers (Medium) 

  Should have tested throughly before submission. Think carefully about whether
  `>` or `>=` should be used at the decision boundary.

## Two pointers
- 880 Decoded String at Index (Medium)

  My solution is to use two pointers and recursion. This is not optimal.
  [A better solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/decoded-string-at-index/discuss/354312/Python-Simple-Intuitive-Solution) 
  is to decode the string to be longer than `K`. Then go 
  backwards to find what is the `K-th` character. Again comprehensive testing
  is needed before the submission.
